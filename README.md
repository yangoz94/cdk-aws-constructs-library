## Usage

Each construct is designed to be modular and follows AWS best practices. They can be used independently or combined to create complex infrastructure patterns. Detailed documentation and examples are available in each construct's source code.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
